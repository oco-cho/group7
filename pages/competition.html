        <p>As the current Whiskey Scout, Mr. Strand has reviewed over 1,500 spirits and cocktails. He has judged cocktail competitions for several distilleries including Dewar’s, Monkey Shoulder, and WhistlePig.

In spite of this, Mr. Strand says, “It’s not my job to tell you what you should or shouldn’t like. It’s my duty and privilege to provide guideposts on the journey—to provide the tools, information, and expertise necessary for each person to decide for themselves.” Follow him as he blazes the trail on Facebook and Instagram @thewhiskeyscout and enjoy the journey!</p>
